Create translation file structure:\n   - Create public/locales/{en,fr,de,es}/translation.json files\n   - Implement comprehensive translation keys for all UI elements\n   - Include pluralization rules and context-specific translations\n   - Add date/time formatting configurations for each locale\n\n3. Implement language detection and preference management:\n   - Configure browser language detection with localStorage persistence\n   - Create custom hooks for language switching (useLanguage, useTranslation)\n   - Implement user preference storage in Tauri's app data directory\n   - Add language selector component with flag icons\n\n4. Set up React i18next integration:\n   - Configure i18next provider at app root level\n   - Implement translation components and hooks throughout the application\n   - Add namespace support for modular translations\n   - Configure lazy loading for translation resources\n\n5. Create language management utilities:\n   - Implement language validation and fallback mechanisms\n   - Add translation key validation in development mode\n   - Create helper functions for date/number formatting per locale\n   - Set up translation file hot-reloading for development\n\n6. Tauri backend integration:\n   - Implement Tauri commands for language preference persistence\n   - Add system locale detection through Tauri APIs\n   - Configure app menu translations for native menus",

# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Auto-Updater for Launcher
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and validate an automatic update system for the launcher itself. The core implementation exists in src/hooks/useAutoAppUpdate.ts but requires comprehensive testing and validation before being considered complete.
# Details:
The auto-updater has been implemented using Tauri with React integration in src/hooks/useAutoAppUpdate.ts. The implementation includes development/production mode handling, but requires thorough testing and validation:

1. Test auto-update functionality in production environment
2. Validate version detection and update availability checks
3. Test update download and installation process
4. Validate error handling during update process
5. Test user interface components (notifications, progress indicators)
6. Validate automatic restart functionality after updates
7. Create comprehensive test scenarios for different update cases
8. Document the complete update process and troubleshooting

The existing implementation appears functional but must be tested in real-world conditions before validation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Set up production-like testing environment for auto-updater
2. Test update detection with mock and real version servers
3. Verify complete update download and installation workflow
4. Test error scenarios (network failures, corrupted downloads, installation failures)
5. Validate user interface behavior during update process
6. Test automatic restart and post-update verification
7. Perform regression testing to ensure launcher functionality remains intact
8. Test update process across different operating systems
9. Validate rollback scenarios if update fails
10. Document test results and create troubleshooting guide

# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Differential Downloads (Phase 2)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the download manager to support differential updates for optimized bandwidth usage.
# Details:
1. Implement bsdiff/xdelta3 for generating and applying patches
2. Develop server-side delta generation process
3. Modify download manager to handle differential updates
4. Implement fallback to full download if patch fails
5. Create version chain management for cumulative updates
6. Optimize patch application process for performance
7. Implement integrity validation for patched files

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test patch generation and application
2. Test differential update process end-to-end
3. Verify fallback mechanism to full downloads
4. Test version chain updates
5. Performance testing for patch application
6. Verify integrity of patched files

# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Download Manager (Phase 1)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Validate and test the existing sophisticated download manager implementation with multi-chunk downloads, pause/resume functionality, and React integration.
# Details:
The download manager has been implemented in src-tauri/src/download_manager.rs with advanced features including multi-chunk downloads, pause/resume, and partial download management. A React hook useDownloadManager.ts exists for frontend integration. However, this implementation has NOT been tested and must be thoroughly validated before being considered complete.

Key areas requiring validation:
1. Basic download functionality
2. Multi-chunk download system
3. Pause/resume capabilities
4. Error handling and retry mechanisms
5. React hook integration
6. Bandwidth management
7. Automated testing suite
8. API documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Create comprehensive test suite for download manager core functionality
2. Test multi-chunk download performance and reliability
3. Validate pause/resume functionality under various scenarios
4. Test error handling with network interruptions and server errors
5. Verify React hook integration and state management
6. Performance testing for bandwidth throttling
7. Integration testing with game installation workflow
8. Create automated regression tests

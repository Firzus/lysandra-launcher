# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Internationalization (i18n) System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive internationalization system supporting French, English, German, and Spanish with automatic language detection, user preference management, and React i18next integration.
# Details:
1. Install and configure React i18next dependencies:
   - Install react-i18next, i18next, i18next-browser-languagedetector, i18next-http-backend
   - Set up i18next configuration with language detection, fallback languages, and resource loading

2. Create translation file structure:
   - Create public/locales/{en,fr,de,es}/translation.json files
   - Implement comprehensive translation keys for all UI elements
   - Include pluralization rules and context-specific translations
   - Add date/time formatting configurations for each locale

3. Implement language detection and preference management:
   - Configure browser language detection with localStorage persistence
   - Create custom hooks for language switching (useLanguage, useTranslation)
   - Implement user preference storage in Tauri's app data directory
   - Add language selector component with flag icons

4. Set up React i18next integration:
   - Configure i18next provider at app root level
   - Implement translation components and hooks throughout the application
   - Add namespace support for modular translations
   - Configure lazy loading for translation resources

5. Create language management utilities:
   - Implement language validation and fallback mechanisms
   - Add translation key validation in development mode
   - Create helper functions for date/number formatting per locale
   - Set up translation file hot-reloading for development

6. Tauri backend integration:
   - Implement Tauri commands for language preference persistence
   - Add system locale detection through Tauri APIs
   - Configure app menu translations for native menus

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test language detection logic with different browser settings
   - Verify translation key resolution and fallback behavior
   - Test language switching functionality and persistence
   - Validate pluralization rules for all supported languages

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test complete language switching workflow from UI
   - Verify translation loading and caching mechanisms
   - Test language preference persistence across app restarts
   - Validate system locale detection integration

3. Manual Testing:
   - Switch between all four languages and verify UI translations
   - Test automatic language detection with different browser locales
   - Verify date/time formatting for each locale
   - Test missing translation key handling and fallbacks
   - Validate language selector component functionality

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify screen reader compatibility with translated content
   - Test keyboard navigation for language selector
   - Validate proper text direction and layout for all languages

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure translation loading times and bundle sizes
   - Test lazy loading of translation resources
   - Verify memory usage with multiple language files loaded
